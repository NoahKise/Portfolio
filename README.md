# Portfolio

#### By Noah Kise

#### A basic portfolio webpage that will eventually be used as a landing page in Github to introduce myself and showcase my projects and growth as a developer.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* VS Code
* Git

## Description

This is a personal portfolio webpage created for the first code review assignment at Epicodus. It contains a headshot, my name, a brief introductory paragraph that talks about my employment and educational background. It also contains descriptions of my coding projects so far with links, and some of my hobbies with links to further explore my relationship with them.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* To view portfolio on the web, open a web broswer and type https://noahkise.github.io/portfolio into the navigation bar and press enter.
* To view github repository containing code, open a web browser and type https://github.com/NoahKise/Portfolio into the navigation bar and press enter.

## Known Bugs

* I was unable to style my embedded Bandcamp player in any meaningful way. I wanted to center it in its box and give it responsize size scaling, and I was unable to accomplish either. As such, certain viewport sizees may result in a sub-optimal display.
